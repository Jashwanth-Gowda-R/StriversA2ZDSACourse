// Find minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

/*
Given an integer array nums of size N, sorted in ascending order with distinct values, and then rotated an unknown number of times (between 1 and N), find the minimum element in the array.


Example 1

Input : nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Output: 0

Explanation: Here, the element 0 is the minimum element in the array.

Example 2

Input : nums = [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]

Output: 1

Explanation:Here, the element 1 is the minimum element in the array.
